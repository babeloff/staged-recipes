= Test Document for Asciidoctor-Diagram

This is a test document to verify that the asciidoctor-diagram extension can process PlantUML diagrams correctly.

== Simple Sequence Diagram

The following diagram tests basic PlantUML functionality:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Hello
Bob --> Alice: Hi there
note right of Alice: This is a test
note left of Bob: Diagram processing
@enduml

== Simple Class Diagram

Testing another diagram type using an external PlantUML file:

[plantuml]
----
include::class-diagram.puml[]
----

End of test document.
